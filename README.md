## About

K8s Lens represents a paradigm shift in Kubernetes operations management. Designed for organizations running mission-critical workloads at scale, it delivers intelligent observability and autonomous remediation capabilities that reduce operational overhead while improving system reliability.

Traditional Kubernetes management tools excel at data collection but fall short on actionable intelligence. K8s Lens bridges this gap by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze cluster telemetry, identify failure patterns, and automatically execute remediation strategies. The result is a self-optimizing infrastructure that maintains high availability with minimal human intervention.

Our platform serves as a force multiplier for engineering teams, enabling them to manage increasingly complex Kubernetes environments without proportional increases in headcount or operational burden. By codifying operational expertise into automated workflows, K8s Lens ensures consistent incident response, reduces MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution), and allows engineers to focus on strategic initiatives rather than reactive firefighting.

Built on extensible architecture principles, K8s Lens integrates seamlessly with existing observability stacks including Prometheus, Grafana, and enterprise APM solutions. The open-source foundation ensures transparency, auditability, and community-driven innovation, while maintaining the robustness required for production deployments across regulated industries.

## Key Capabilities

### 🌟 Intelligent Analysis & Diagnostics
Advanced AI models continuously analyze cluster state, resource utilization patterns, and application health metrics to provide deep insights into system behavior. Our diagnostic engine identifies root causes across complex dependency chains, significantly reducing troubleshooting time.

### 🌟 Enterprise Security & Compliance
Comprehensive security posture management including RBAC analysis, vulnerability scanning, policy enforcement, and continuous compliance monitoring against industry standards (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS). Automated audit trails ensure full traceability for regulated environments.

### 🌟 Autonomous Remediation
Self-healing capabilities that detect and resolve common failure scenarios without human intervention. Extensible plugin architecture allows organizations to codify institutional knowledge into automated remediation workflows.

### 🌟 Multi-Cluster Operations
Unified control plane for managing heterogeneous Kubernetes environments across cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and edge locations. Centralized visibility with distributed execution ensures scalability.

### 🌟 Performance Optimization
Predictive analytics drive intelligent scaling decisions and resource optimization recommendations. Machine learning models identify inefficiencies and suggest cost-saving opportunities without sacrificing performance.

### 🌟 Advanced Integrations
Native integration with Prometheus for metrics collection, support for custom dashboards, and webhook-based alert routing to existing incident management platforms. RESTful API enables custom workflows and automation.

## Enterprise Features

### RBAC Security Analysis

Comprehensive role-based access control assessment providing risk scoring, permission auditing, and compliance validation. Our analysis engine identifies overly permissive roles, detects privilege escalation vectors, and generates recommendations for least-privilege configurations.

**Capabilities:**
- Risk assessment scoring with actionable remediation paths
- Compliance measurement against security benchmarks (CIS, NSA/CISA)
- Automated security improvement recommendations
- Comprehensive audit reporting with change tracking

### Security Scanning

Multi-layered security validation spanning container images, runtime configurations, and network policies. Continuous vulnerability assessment with integration to industry-standard CVE databases.

**Capabilities:**
- Container image vulnerability detection and severity classification
- Network policy validation and segmentation analysis
- Secrets management audit and exposure detection
- Compliance checking for regulatory frameworks

### Autonomous Operations

Intelligent automation framework that reduces operational toil while maintaining system reliability. Extensible plugin architecture allows organizations to encode operational best practices into reusable remediation workflows.

**Supported Remediation Scenarios:**
- Pod lifecycle management (restarts, evictions, migrations)
- Resource optimization (scaling, limit adjustments)
- Network healing (endpoint regeneration, DNS updates)
- Storage operations (volume provisioning, snapshot management)

## Architecture

### System Design

K8s Lens employs a distributed architecture optimized for scalability and reliability. The analysis engine processes cluster telemetry through multiple specialized pipelines, while the remediation framework executes corrective actions through a plugin-based system.

```

### Remediation Framework

```go
// Extensible remediation interface
type Remediator interface {
    // Determines if this remediator can handle the issue
    CanFix(issueType string) bool
    
    // Executes remediation logic
    Remediate(ctx context.Context, resource, namespace string) (*RemediationResult, error)
    
    // Validates remediation success
    Verify(ctx context.Context, resource, namespace string) (bool, error)
}
```
